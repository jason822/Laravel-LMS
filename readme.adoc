We recommend:

1. All "Security Privileges" for the "superuser" role.
2. All "High Educational Privileges" for the "instructor" role along with "edit-profile" from "Other Privileges".
3. All "Low Education Privileges" for the "student" role along with "edit-profile" from "Other Privileges".
4. "view-course", "view-announcement", and "edit-profile" for the "guest" role.

However, you can design your own role/permission combination.

=== Requirements

- C/C++ Dependencies and Compilers
- Perl Dependencies
- Composer: https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx[Check Composer Official Website]

=== Guide  

In your terminal, 

- Clone: ```git clone https://github.com/ci-oc/basic-lms-laravel.git```
- Navigate: ```cd basic-lms-laravel```
- Update your depencencies as they are specified in `composer.json`: ```composer update```
- Composer re-reads the `composer.json` file to build up the list of files to autoload: ```composer dump-autoload```
- Create a cache file for faster configuration loading: ```php artisan config:cache```
- Flush the application cache: ```php artisan config:clear```

[#database-configuration]
==== Database Configuration

- ```cat .env.example >> .env```
- ```vim .env```

Then configure your database credentials in the following part:

``` 
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=DATABASE_NAME
DB_USERNAME=MYSQL_USERNAME # default is root 
DB_PASSWORD=MYSQL_PASSWORD

```

Also make sure you have the following configuration in your **.env** file.

```
BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=array
SESSION_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_DRIVER=database
```

===== Database Seeding

In order to seed database with accounts. Please run the following command:
- `php artisan migrate --seed`

If you want to disable seeding for specific table. Please open the following file.
- `vim PATH/TO/basic-lms-laravel/database/seeds/DatabaseSeeder.php`

And then you can comment by `#` any of the following seeders.

[TIP]
But note that you can only comment/uncomment instructors and/or students seeders, because superuser accounts are only created through seeding.

Example:

```php
$this->call(PermissionTableSeeder::class);
$this->call(JudgeOptionsSeeder::class);
$this->call(RoleTableSeeder::class);
$this->call(SuperUserTableSeeder::class);
$this->call(SecurityURLSeeder::class);
# $this->call(InstructorsTableSeeder::class);
# $this->call(StudentsTableSeeder::class);
$this->call(CodingLanguagesSeeder::class);  
```
